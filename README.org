* Welcome!
  Documentation for the documentation! MEETTTAAAA...

  For realsies though, this repository contains all of Curb's
  important documentation, primarily for the Curb API, but for future
  projects we will use this repository and domain [[http://docs.energycurb.com][docs.energycurb.com]]
  to feed our documentation to you.

* Edit / contribute to docs
  Checkout this repository and start editing anything in =src/*.rst=;
  the [[http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html][Sphinx Docs]] are a great place to start too.

* To build the docs
  Simply =cd src= and =make html=. The html docs will be generated
  then rsync'ed to this root directory. Publishing only requires you
  to commit and then push :)
